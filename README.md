# Trader Brothers Client Database System

A complete client management system with a booking form frontend and REST API backend for managing client data via Make.com HTTP requests.

## üìÅ File Structure

Your project should have this structure:
```
trader-brothers-client-database/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Frontend booking form
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # Frontend JavaScript
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js           # Backend database server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json        # Dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore          # Git ignore file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it `trader-brothers-client-database`
3. Make it **Public** (required for free Render deployment)
4. Don't initialize with README (we'll upload our own files)

### Step 2: Upload Files to GitHub

1. Click "uploading an existing file" or use Git commands
2. Upload these files in this exact order:
   - `package.json` (upload first)
   - `server.js`
   - `index.html`
   - `script.js`
   - `.gitignore`
   - `README.md`

### Step 3: Deploy Backend to Render

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and create a free account
2. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: `trader-brothers-client-db` (or your choice)
   - **Environment**: `Node`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Plan**: Select "Free"
5. Click "Create Web Service"
6. Wait for deployment (5-10 minutes)
7. Copy your Render URL (looks like: `https://trader-brothers-client-db.onrender.com`)

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend

You have several options for the frontend:

#### Option A: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Free)
1. In your GitHub repo, go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select "main" branch and "/ (root)"
4. Click Save
5. Your form will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/trader-brothers-client-database`

#### Option B: Netlify (Alternative)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop your `index.html`, `script.js` files
3. Get your Netlify URL

#### Option C: Render Static Site
1. In Render, click "New +" ‚Üí "Static Site"
2. Connect same GitHub repo
3. Set publish directory to `/`
4. Deploy

### Step 5: Configure Frontend

1. Open `script.js` in your repository
2. Find this line: `const CLIENT_API_URL = 'https://your-render-app-name.onrender.com';`
3. Replace with your actual Render URL from Step 3
4. Commit the change to GitHub

## üîß API Usage for Make.com

## üîÑ Make.com Integration Examples

### Example 1: Add New Client
1. In Make.com, create an HTTP module
2. Set Method to `POST`
3. Set URL to `https://YOUR-RENDER-URL/clients`
4. Add Header: `Content-Type: application/json`
5. Set Body:
```json
{
    "clientId": "{{clientId}}",
    "name": "{{fullName}}",
    "email": "{{email}}",
    "phone": "{{phone}}"
}
```

### Example 2: Get All Clients
1. HTTP module with `GET` method
2. URL: `https://YOUR-RENDER-URL/clients`
3. Use response in subsequent modules

### Example 3: Delete Client
1. HTTP module with `DELETE` method
2. URL: `https://YOUR-RENDER-URL/clients/clientId/{{clientId}}`

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Test Backend
1. Visit your Render URL directly (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com`)
2. You should see a JSON response with API documentation
3. Try: `https://your-app.onrender.com/clients` to see default clients

### Test Frontend
1. Visit your frontend URL
2. The form should load with "Loading clients..." initially
3. After a few seconds, you should see client buttons (John Smith, Sarah Johnson, Mike Wilson)
4. Click a client button to auto-populate the form
5. Click "Refresh Clients" to reload from your database

### Test Make.com Integration
1. Create a test scenario in Make.com
2. Use the HTTP module to GET `https://your-render-url/clients`
3. Run the scenario - you should receive the client data

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Frontend can't load clients
- Check that `CLIENT_API_URL` in `script.js` matches your Render URL
- Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
- Ensure Render service is running (not sleeping)

### Render deployment fails
- Check that `package.json` was uploaded first
- Verify all dependencies are listed correctly
- Check Render build logs for specific errors

### CORS errors
- The server includes CORS headers - this should not be an issue
- If problems persist, check that requests are going to the correct URL

### Database not persisting
- Free Render services restart periodically and lose SQLite data
- For production, consider upgrading to a paid plan or using external database

## üìä Default Clients

The system starts with three default clients:
- **John Smith** (TB-001)
- **Sarah Johnson** (TB-002) 
- **Mike Wilson** (TB-003)

You can add, update, or delete these via the API endpoints.

## üîí Security Notes

- This is a basic implementation suitable for development/testing
- For production use, consider adding authentication
- Input validation is basic - enhance as needed
- Free Render services have limitations - monitor usage

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check Render logs for server errors
3. Verify all URLs are correct
4. Test API endpoints directly using a tool like Postman

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once everything is working:
1. Test all Make.com integrations
2. Add more clients via the API
3. Customize the booking form as needed
4. Consider upgrading to paid hosting for production use
